## Automated Attendance Tracking

A Python program designed to help teachers streamline attendance.
This program scans a student's ID number and sign's them into the classroom.
This application gives the time that the student sign's in and also has a time slot in which the student is allowed to sign in.
The student has a 4 minute time slot to sign in.
The program also creates a file that stores all of the people that signed in.
